
# Weather App

A simple weather app built in Python using Tkinter for the user interface, requests library for API calls, and ttkbootstrap for a stylish UI.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### API Key

Obtain an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and replace the `api_key` variable in the script with your key.

## Usage

1. Run the script `weather-app.py`.
2. Enter the city name in the provided entry field.
3. Click the "Search" button to retrieve weather information.
4. The app will display the city name, weather icon, temperature, wind speed, and description.

## Customization

- Modify the script to include additional features or customize the UI.
- Explore [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for more weather data options.
